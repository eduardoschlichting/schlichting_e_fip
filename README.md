# Tide - Beer Scented Detergent - Final Integrated Project :computer:

![Home of Tide](images/home-header-desktop.gif)

## Hello There! Good to have you here! ðŸ‘‹

This is a HTML, CSS and JavaScript based project done for the Final Integrated Project of the Interactive Media Design program at Fanshawe College. Built with the latest technologies and best practices in web design, all the visuals, code, and functionality were built by me (Eduardo, such a cool guy!) from scratch!

## The challenge :cold_sweat:

Our task was to build a five-page not-so-static webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

One of the main requirements was to build some interactivity with JS, including but not limited to: micro interactions, UI designs, animations, and the main task: store some data in an array and retrieve it somewhere in the page (this can be located in the 'How to Use' page).

## Features :metal:

This project was built using the latest web development technologies, and also, for the visuals, Cinema 3D, After Effects and Adobe Premiere were put into work.

### 3D Elements :moyai:
	- All the bottles and 3D animations were built using Cinema 4D;

### Visual Effects :clapper:
	- Both videos present on the page were recorded, edited, colour graded and finished by me, on After Effects and Premiere.


### Graphics :framed_picture:
	- The Tide Brand and labels were drawn and vectorized from scratch.

	- Background images were taken from a royalty-free source, edited, and customized to our necessities.

### Animations :joystick:
	- The basic animations were built with keyframes on css, such as svgs;
	- Animations triggered on scroll were built using the AOS Library, authorized by Trevor Van Rys;
		The code snippet is:
		``` JavaScript
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.js"></script>
		<script>
		  AOS.init();
		</script>
		```
